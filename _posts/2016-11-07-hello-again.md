title: Hello (Again)
---

So here's something new (not) - I've decided to start a new blog again.

In my new blog there will be only technical and academic related topics,
including **and** limited to:

- Progress reports with AOSC related work/fun.
- Commentaries on past political events and some literature.
- Coverage on some devices in my possession.

To fit the theme of this blog, I will also down-sample all thumbnails of
photos uploaded to 256 color and compressed to under XGA (1024*768 that is)
resolutions - and click for full sized pictures.

Let's get right in shall we.
