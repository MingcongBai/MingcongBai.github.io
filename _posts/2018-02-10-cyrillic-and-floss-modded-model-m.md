title: Russian Cyrillic, and Floss Modded IBM Model M
---

With summer closing in, I'm planning on upgrading my IBM NetVista sleeper build
to year 2017 specs (probably swapping out my Ryzen 7 1800X from the
[server build](https://mingcongbai.wtf/blog/dan-case-ryzen-build-2018)
to a new mATX motherboard, and put a Ryzen 2000 series into the
sever), and in case you don't know what that's about, here's a quick
[tour](https://imgur.com/gallery/8HsYp) I made several months ago upon a
fellow Redditor's request. With the upgrade, the not-obviously-modern NetVista
would become my main desktop system...

The NetVista is outfitted with a 1987-made IBM Model M keyboard - an absolute
joy to type on. However, with my Russian language studying progressing to a
second major, it is about time to learn and type on a true, native Russian
keyboard layout (Phonetic works, sure, but I still want to learn the "weh").

Apart from that, I'll be moving in with a new roommate who's quite a dedicate
learner - it would be quite rude to disrupt his work with the buckling springs
clashing all the time, so it become necessary to figure out a solution to reduce
the keyboard's noise output.

And now with both issues resolved, I think it might be beneficial to leave
a blog post describing the process here - as a personal note, and possibly a
useful guide for others.

*Keycaps...*

It is practically impossible to find a set of authentic, manufactured-for-IBM
Russian keycaps (thankfully Russian keyboard layout is also 101-key, like
U.S. English), not even a whole keyboard. However, all hope's not lost.

There are several ways forward, one of the most obvious choice is to find a
keycap manufacturer to custom build a set for you - I've found people who
were willing to do so on Etsy. However, there's a better choice in case you
would like a built-to-spec set of keycaps that is guaranteed to be compatible
with the Model M.

The solution would be to contact Unicomp, a Kentucky-based keyboard manufacturer
who bought rights to continue to build and sell keyboards based on the buckling
springs switches - and in fact, based on the Model M itself. After contacting
their (extremely helpful and responsive) support staff, they pointed me
[here](http://www.pckeyboard.com/page/product/CPSET).

The page would allow you to purchase a full set of Model M compatible keycaps,
based on your specifications. You would only have to mention in the "Comments"
box that...

- You would like a set of keycaps with Russian layout printings on them.
- You would like the colour to be "Pearl/Pebble", to match the original colours
  of the IBM Model M.

Another tip is that, if you are located in the United States, make sure you
select the "US Flat Rate Shipping" - which is the cheapest option and it is
in fact USPS Priority Mail. Shipping from Kentucky, it should get to the
majority of locations in the lower-48 states.

I have to give them credit for their customer service, from the beginning of my
first inquiry, it took them less than 6 hours to ship out my keycaps and I
received them the day after in a clean and well packed box.

*But how are the keycaps?*

They are great, and seems to be dyesubbed. The colour doesn't exactly match the
original, however, it doesn't seem very obvious at all that it would clash
with the colour of the casing. The keycaps comes in two pieces for most keys,
like it did with the original Model M.

However, it is worth mentioning that, while the keycaps fits a Model M, it is
recommended to use the original inner cap so that the keycaps stays on the same
height as it used to. Another caveat is that the keycaps doesn't appear to be
quite on par with the original IBM quality, some keys do deform around the
lower edges when pressed onto the keyboard, but you would hardly notice it
when all keycaps are replaced.

Here below are two pictures of the keyboard, and a close-up of the keycaps
themselves, so you could see and judge for yourselves...

*Noise dampening...*

The majority of the distracting noises a Model M would emit is from the
springs themselves, as keys are depressed and released, the springs make a
high pitched "ringing" sound which could be quite annoying for some - not me,
but one has to care for others eh?

Anyways, one of the most widely practiced method would be the so-called "Dental
Floss Mod", as described in the
[Deskthority Wiki article](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Dental_floss_mod).
I found the following recipe especially effective...

- A box of Oral-B SuperFloss(TM), 50 pieces (you would barely use more than 10).
- A pair of scissors with relatively sharp blades, to avoid fraying in the
  floss strings.
- A plastic pryer or a harder card - do not use anything metal or you risk
  damaging the keycaps and the keyboard housing.
    - Take the chance to clean the inside of your keyboard, will you?
- We would only need to use the "fluffy" or "spongy" portion of a floss, so cut
  and discard the rest (or if you really want to use it, go ahead).
- Cut the fluffy portion into segments of 1.5cm and insert them to the centre
  of the springs. Going under would make the effect less significant (noiser),
  while going over would completely destroy the tactile pattern, making the
  keys mushy.
    - It is generally a good practice to cut and measure each time you cut,
      though the general rule of thumb is to cut longer than you need and trim
      back if needed - the 1.5cm length is to match the length of the spring
      itself, try and make it as long as the spring, but **never** longer.
    - Sometimes if the key appears to be mushy, try and reinstall your keycap,
      inserting the keycaps could depress the springs and make the floss
      jump out higher than the springs.

After all these are done, you should no longer hear the "ringing" noise when
typing, though you will still hear the initial "click" as the buckling springs
actuate - not exactly silencing the keyboard, but quiet enough not to annoy
someone to death. The mod should not alter the physical typing experience, if it
does, shorten your floss.

Personally I find the new noise output quite similar to that of the Cherry MX
Browns' with a hint of the Blues - if you know what I mean... Well let's try
this again.

- You will hear a "click", but nowhere nearly as high pitched as the Cherry
  MX Blues.
- The key would make a low-toned "thunk" as it bottoms out, quite similar to
  the Cherry MX Browns.

Here's a picture of the finished product - sorry I don't have a macro lens on
me so it might not be very visible at all. There are plenty of better pictures
on the Internet if you Google "dental floss mod model m".
