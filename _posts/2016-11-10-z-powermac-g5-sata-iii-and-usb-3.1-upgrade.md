title: PowerMac G5 SATA III and USB 3.1 Upgrade
---

So, earlier "today", I was tinkling with data migration on my PowerMac G5. Currently, my
G5 holds 3 hard drives, two of which driven by a SATA III (6.0Gbps) controller; also, a
USB 3.1 + USB Type-C card was also added to the machine.

So, why?
--------

PowerMac G5 comes with a SATA storage controller - identified by Linux as follows:

```
Unassigned class [ff00]: Apple Inc. Shasta Mac I/O
...
Unassigned class [ff00]: Apple Inc. Shasta IDE
```

While it's quite awesome for a early 2000s machine to ship with a SATA controller - and
higher-end Macintoshes in the 90s were also shipped with SCSI controllers for their hard
drive - it is the speed of the controller (well, and the sale on Amazon) which has driven
me to this upgrade.

And also... I own a Nexus 5X, which uses a USB Type-C interface, with limited power outlet
avilability in my dorm room, it would be really nice if I could charge my phone - fast
charging enabled - on one of my computers (Lenovo, get Type-C on X270 please, I'm counting
on it) - therefore a USB 3.1 and Type-C controller was also purchased.

Before I start getting into the details, note that this upgrade is only tested on my
PowerMac G5 11,2 (Late 2005) (and with that I seriously doubt any other machines will work
with this upgrade) - which were shipped with a PCI Express bus - as opposed to the PCI-X
bus shipped with older G5 models:

- 1 * PCI Express 16x slot (usually occupied by the graphics card)
- 2 * PCI Express 8x slots
- 1 * PCI Express 4x slot

Right model? Awesome.
---------------------

Well no. I wasn't sure if this would work before - upgrades of this nature were not
very well documented (motive of this blog post), as most of the folks playing around G5s
kept themselves to OS X - which by no surprise would not work with newer PCI Express based
upgrades, let alone with a SATA III and USB 3.1 controller card (Apple doesn't care any
more about these machines, stop daydreaming).

But in the end it turned out okay, ... *(Relief)*

... So, for this upgrade, two cards were put into the machine:

```
USB controller: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM1142 USB 3.1 Host Controller
SATA controller: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM1062 Serial ATA Controller (rev 01)
```

And they were fitted in the machine in a setup as follows:

- USB 3.1 card was put into the 8x slot on the very top of the PCIe compartment:
  - Power comes from a SATA 15-pin interface, which is splitted using a SATA power cable
  splitter (there are models available using standard/mini molex power connectors).
- SATA III card was put into the 4x slot:
  - No need for extra power input to the card, you would need to use a SATA power cable
  splitter to connect the power straight onto the extra hard drive(s).
  - Standard SATA cables were used to connect from the controller card to the hard drives.
- I have also purchased a 2.5 to 3.5 HDD caddy made by Cosair, which fits two 2.5 inch
hard drives in a single 3.5 caddy - nice!

With all those in place, it's time to mangle with the cables. This is the part which I
find ironic with G5s' interiors - space for cable management is *very* limited, so be
prepared for a lot of nails-against-aluminium joy.

But anyways...

There is a gap between the mesh on the rear of the machine and the upper frame separator
(between the PCIe compartment and the HDD compartment) - route all cables between this
gap. It won't be very neat after all, as you can see in the photo below.

But it looks way neater from the outside, which I'm fine with.

And now...
----------

Both cards should work out of the box with Linux Kernels newer than 4.6 (USB 3.1 support
was just added with that branch, if you are not planning on adding a USB 3.1 card, you
should be able to get away with anything newer than 2.6, I could be wrong - but I have
no interest in semi-ancient Kernels anyways).

Then, I was at where I left off earlier today, leaving this photo at the
[Prologue](unlimited-data-migration-works).

More fun ahead
--------------

However, things have just gotten more interesting from this point on.

Now that I have SATA III, there are some re-arrangement to make - which I believe would
be more appropriate in a multi-drive system. Let me clarify some notations:

- **0,1**: 500GB HDD on the original "Shasta" S/ATA controller.
- **1,1**: 1TB HDD on the SATA III controller.
- **1,2**: 120GB SSD on the SATA III controller.

So, here's the re-arrangement plan:

- **0,1** will be stripped of all its contents except for my ~300GB collection of
  photographs, *Yaboot* (Linux/OS X boot manager for NewWorld PowerPC Macs) and the
  *Linux Kernel images*.
- **1,1** will be used for compiling (this PowerMac G5 is responsible for the PPC and
  PPC64 port of AOSC OS) and system containers (BuildKits and such).
- **1,2** will hold my daily system.

So why does **0,1** have to hold the Kernel image and Yaboot? PowerPC Macintoshes uses a 
special "Apple" partition map, and it expects the bootloader to be on the HDD attached to
the "Shasta" controller. A new partition map is now created on **0,1** as follows:

```
/dev/sdc
        #                type name       length   base      system
/dev/sdc1 Apple_partition_map Apple          63 @ 1         Partition map
/dev/sdc2     Apple_Bootstrap untitled     1954 @ 64        NewWorld bootblock
/dev/sdc3     Apple_UNIX_SVR2 Photos  975722525 @ 2018      Linux native
/dev/sdc4          Apple_Free Extra          49 @ 975724543 Free space
```

(Output of `mac-fdisk` print function)

Where:

- `/dev/sdc1` holds the actual partition map (quite a quirky design).
- `/dev/sdc2`, or the bootstrap partition, holds the Yaboot bootloader.
- `/dev/sdc3` is used for Kernel images and Photos.
- `/dev/sdc4` is free space mapped as a partition (weird, and possibly stupid IMHO).

I have to admit, there is one f*ck-up in this setup, I forgot to separate a partition for
the Kernel images - but at the same time, I can't be bothered, access control will take
care of it for me.

Then, I used GPT (yes, GPT) partition maps on the other two, like how they came out of my
laptops - You only have to use "Apple" partition map for the boot HDD only, you are free
to use any partition maps for other HDDs - I figured using GPT is good enough (way better
than the silly "Apple" format anyways), so I didn't bother recreating a new parition map.

I formatted both partitions on **1,1** and **1,2** with Btrfs, appropriately:

```
Disk /dev/sda: 117.4 GiB, 126035288064 bytes, 246162672 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: DBE4B330-CF6E-41A0-945B-59EF0131D068

Device         Start       End   Sectors  Size Type
/dev/sda1       2048 209717247 209715200  100G Linux filesystem
/dev/sda2  209717248 246162638  36445391 17.4G Linux filesystem


Disk /dev/sdb: 931.5 GiB, 1000204886016 bytes, 1953525168 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 647ACEF0-A221-4079-BEE8-184287FDD6A3

Device     Start        End    Sectors   Size Type
/dev/sdb1   2048 1953525134 1953523087 931.5G Linux filesystem
```

Transfer time!
--------------

Now, it's time to transfer the system root to the new SSD. Interesting enough, with
`rsync`, you don't event have to use a Live media (although I would recommend that you
stop as much services as possible, including desktop environments and such) - just use
the method described in the ArchWiki article (link attached in the references section
below):

```
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
# rsync -axX --info=progress2 \
        --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*", \
        "/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /mnt
# sync
```

This will take a very, very long time (~2 hours in my case). The system should boot right
away after the transfer, given nothing bad happened.

The only thing left to do is re-configuring Yaboot to match your new boot setup. I won't
get into details here, you can always check its manpages.
