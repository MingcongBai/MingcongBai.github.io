Academic Resources
==================

I figured that I should share my class notes (University of Wisconsin - Madison) for those who are interested:

**Spring 2018 (2,2)**

Starting from this semester I will attempt to transcribe all my hand-written notes to Markdown documents, similar to what was done in the first year. There may be delays, and please note that these notes are only transcribed to ease the search and reference process - they might not seem organised. If you have any questions, do email me at [mbai8@wisc.edu](mailto:mbai8@wisc.edu) and I will try and respond as soon as possible.
