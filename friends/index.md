Friends

There are many brilliant blogs out there (me not included), and better yet,
they are my friends' blogs. Go and check them out!

**Tong Hui's Blog - "FOSS Geek"**

on current happenings in and around the world of free and open source software
communities. Also, a bunch of experience sharing on Ubuntu and Debian usage,
and application recommendations.

**Junde Yhi's Blog - "Hello from Junde Yhi"**

[https://lmy441900.github.io/](https://lmy441900.github.io/), long-time friend
of mine, cyber security and encryption enthusiast, and the main hands behind
the AOSC OS MIPS/Loongson Port (God bless his heart). Infrequent writer like
me, but with way superior quality.
